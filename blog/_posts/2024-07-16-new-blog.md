Our new webpage is up and running. Our goal with this site is to be more open communication about our science. This blog is a continuation of this thought process. While most of our scientific communication happens through meetings, conferences, workshops, papers, and talks - most of this communication is formal and for scientific audience. 

With this blog, we will communicate our scientific thought process, experiments, interesting things that may happen during our investigations, and may be some opinion communication as well. We will see how it goes !
